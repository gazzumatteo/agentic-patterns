**Pattern**: ReAct (Reason and Act)
**Type**: Foundational + Reasoning
**Framework Support**: Google ADK (reasoning_mode="react"), CrewAI (verbose=True)

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Thought-Action Cycle**: Alternates reasoning and execution
- **Dynamic Planning**: Adjusts based on observations
- **Tool Integration**: Uses tools to gather information
- **Feedback Loop**: Observations inform next thoughts

**Business Value**:
- **Adaptive Problem Solving**: Handles unknown situations
- **Auditability**: Clear reasoning trail
- **Flexibility**: Discovers solutions during execution
- **Intelligence**: Context-aware decision making

**Use Cases**:
- Medical diagnosis
- Incident response
- Investigation workflows
- Research and analysis
- Complex troubleshooting
- Emergency room triage
- Adaptive systems

**Real Example**:
Hospital Network deployed ReAct pattern for ER triage optimization, achieving 31% reduction in critical case response time through adaptive reasoning and action.

**When to Use**:
- Problems can't be solved with predetermined steps
- Context evolves during execution
- High-stakes decisions
- Investigation required
- Path to solution unknown upfront
- Regulated industries needing explanation
- Complex problem-solving

**ReAct Cycle**:
1. **Thought**: Reason about current state
2. **Action**: Decide what to do next
3. **Observation**: Gather results from action
4. **Evaluation**: Check if goal achieved
5. **Loop**: Repeat with new information

**Key Benefits**:
- **Explainability**: Shows reasoning process
- **Adaptability**: Changes approach based on findings
- **Tool Use**: Leverages external information
- **Auditability**: Complete decision trail
