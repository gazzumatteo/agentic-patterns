%% Pattern Documentation
%% ==================
%% Pattern Name: Network/Swarm Pattern
%% Article: Article 2 - Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns
%%
%% Pattern Description:
%% The Network/Swarm Pattern implements decentralized, peer-to-peer agent communication
%% with no central authority. Agents communicate directly with local neighbors, and
%% emergent collective intelligence arises from thousands of simple local interactions.
%% Often called "agent swarm" inspired by biological swarms (ants, birds, fish).
%%
%% Business Value:
%% - Resilience: No single point of failure, system continues if individual agents fail
%% - Scalability: Adds agents without reconfiguring central control
%% - Adaptability: System self-organizes to changing conditions
%% - Efficiency: Local optimization often achieves global optimization
%% - Robustness: Survives failures, corruption, malicious actors
%%
%% Key Characteristics:
%% 1. Decentralized: No central coordinator or controller
%% 2. Peer-to-Peer: Direct agent-to-agent communication
%% 3. Local Rules: Each agent follows simple local rules
%% 4. Emergent Behavior: Complex system behaviors arise from simple rules
%% 5. Self-Organization: System organizes itself without explicit direction
%% 6. Adaptive: Responds to environmental changes dynamically
%%
%% Real-World Use Cases:
%% 1. Warehouse Robot Coordination
%%    - 200 autonomous robots coordinate peer-to-peer
%%    - No central traffic controller
%%    - Self-organizing path optimization, collision avoidance
%%    - Result: 180→340 items/hour, 0 collisions in 6 months, 30% failure tolerance, +26% efficiency
%%
%% 2. Autonomous Vehicle Fleets
%%    - Vehicles communicate with nearby vehicles
%%    - Collective route optimization
%%    - Accident prevention through information sharing
%%    - Result: Safer roads, less congestion, faster delivery
%%
%% 3. IoT Sensor Networks
%%    - Sensors report to nearby neighbors
%%    - Distributed data aggregation
%%    - Network self-heals when sensors fail
%%    - Result: Robust monitoring, lower latency, scalable
%%
%% 4. Distributed Computing
%%    - Nodes coordinate work without central scheduler
%%    - Dynamic load balancing
%%    - Resilient to node failures
%%    - Result: Better resource utilization, fault tolerance
%%
%% 5. Supply Chain Optimization
%%    - Warehouses coordinate shipping with neighbors
%%    - Dynamic inventory rebalancing
%%    - Faster response to demand changes
%%    - Result: Lower stockouts, faster fulfillment
%%
%% 6. Disaster Response
%%    - Emergency response teams coordinate peer-to-peer
%%    - No central command requirement
%%    - Self-organizing task allocation
%%    - Result: Faster response, works despite infrastructure failures
%%
%% Implementation Patterns:
%% - Mesh Network: Each agent connects to multiple neighbors
%% - Gossip Protocol: Information spreads through local sharing
%% - Voting/Consensus: Local decisions aggregate to collective decisions
%% - Pheromone Trails: Agents leave digital "pheromones" for others
%% - Ant Colony Optimization: Inspired by biological swarm behavior
%%
%% When To Use:
%% ✓ Resilience critical, cannot afford single point of failure
%% ✓ Large-scale distributed systems
%% ✓ Operating in unreliable/unpredictable environments
%% ✓ Rapid adaptation to changing conditions needed
%% ✓ Individual agent failures acceptable
%%
%% When NOT To Use:
%% ✗ Centralized control required for compliance
%% ✗ Need deterministic ordering/sequencing
%% ✗ Real-time latency-critical decisions
%% ✗ Require global consistency at all times
%%
%% Communication Patterns:
%% 1. Broadcast: Agent sends to all neighbors
%% 2. Multicast: Agent sends to subset of neighbors
%% 3. Gossip: Information spreads probabilistically
%% 4. Epidemic: Information spreads like biological disease
%% 5. Directed: Specific neighbors based on state
%%
%% Local Rules Examples:
%% 1. Separation: Don't collide with neighbors
%% 2. Alignment: Move in similar direction as neighbors
%% 3. Cohesion: Stay close to neighbors
%% 4. Attraction: Move toward goals
%% 5. Repulsion: Avoid obstacles and threats
%%
%% Emergence Mechanisms:
%% - No explicit system goal, emerges from agent goals
%% - No central planning, emerges from local decisions
%% - No single decision-maker, emerges from voting/consensus
%% - No explicit load balancing, emerges from bidding/negotiation
%%
%% Performance Characteristics:
%% - Latency: Variable (depends on network hops)
%% - Throughput: Scales with number of agents
%% - Scalability: Excellent (designed for 1000s of agents)
%% - Resilience: Excellent (survives massive failures)
%% - Cost: High initial complexity, but scales linearly
%%
%% Monitoring Emergent Behavior:
%% - Particle Swarm Fitness: How well is goal being achieved?
%% - Diversity Metrics: Is swarm exploring or exploiting?
%% - Stability Metrics: Is behavior converging or oscillating?
%% - Fairness: Are all agents contributing equally?
%%
%% Related Patterns:
%% - Hierarchical Pattern: Centralized vs decentralized
%% - Parallel Pattern: Multiple agents, centrally coordinated
%% - Supervisor Pattern: Single router vs many peers
%% - Market-Based Pattern: Economic coordination vs P2P
