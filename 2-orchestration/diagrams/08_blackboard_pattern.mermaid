%% Pattern Documentation
%% ==================
%% Pattern Name: Blackboard Pattern
%% Article: Article 2 - Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns
%%
%% Pattern Description:
%% The Blackboard Pattern creates a shared workspace where multiple agents asynchronously
%% contribute to evolving solutions. Agents read the current state, make contributions,
%% and trigger new rounds of refinement. Inspired by how humans solve complex problems
%% on a literal blackboard—everyone sees the whole picture, can add ideas, and builds
%% on others' work without waiting for synchronization.
%%
%% Business Value:
%% - Collaboration: Diverse expertise combined without requiring explicit coordination
%% - Emergence: Complete solution emerges from specialized contributions
%% - Efficiency: Asynchronous (agents contribute when ready, not when scheduled)
%% - Quality: Multiple perspectives refine solution toward optimality
%% - Flexibility: New agents can be added to improve solutions
%%
%% Key Characteristics:
%% 1. Shared Workspace: Single source of truth for problem state
%% 2. Asynchronous: Agents don't need to synchronize timing
%% 3. Incremental: Solutions improve round by round
%% 4. Expert Contributions: Each agent contributes specialized perspective
%% 5. Knowledge Accumulation: Each round builds on previous rounds
%% 6. Multiple Rounds: Iterate until convergence or time limit
%%
%% Real-World Use Cases:
%% 1. Collaborative Product Design
%%    - Industrial Designer: Aesthetic concepts, form factor
%%    - Engineer: Technical constraints, manufacturability, feasibility
%%    - Cost Analyst: Pricing implications, BOM analysis, margins
%%    - Marketing: Market research, customer preferences, competitive analysis
%%    - Result: 6 months→6 weeks cycles, 8→3 prototype iterations, 7.2→8.9 market fit, -40% dev cost
%%
%% 2. Strategic Planning
%%    - Finance Agent: Budget constraints, ROI analysis
%%    - Operations: Feasibility, resource availability
%%    - Sales: Customer needs, market opportunities
%%    - Product: Technical capabilities, development timeline
%%    - Result: Better strategies, faster consensus, aligned execution
%%
%% 3. Research Problem-Solving
%%    - Literature Agent: Existing solutions, research gaps
%%    - Theory Agent: Theoretical frameworks, mathematical foundations
%%    - Experimental: Practical constraints, testability
%%    - Statistical: Data analysis approaches, validation
%%    - Result: More comprehensive solutions, better research outcomes
%%
%% 4. System Architecture Design
%%    - Front-end Agent: UI/UX requirements, performance needs
%%    - Back-end Agent: Scalability, reliability, data model
%%    - Security Agent: Threat analysis, protection mechanisms
%%    - DevOps: Deployment, monitoring, operations
%%    - Result: Better architectures, fewer redesigns, better deployment
%%
%% 5. Content Creation
%%    - Writer Agent: Content structure, narrative
%%    - Designer: Visual concepts, layout, diagrams
%%    - Technical: Accuracy review, code samples, technical depth
%%    - Editor: Grammar, clarity, consistency, style
%%    - Result: Better content, faster turnaround, higher quality
%%
%% 6. Business Case Development
%%    - Finance Agent: Revenue projections, financial models
%%    - Operations: Cost analysis, resource requirements
%%    - Risk Agent: Risk identification, mitigation strategies
%%    - Legal: Regulatory requirements, compliance issues
%%    - Result: Better business cases, lower approval time
%%
%% Implementation Patterns:
%% - Round-Based: Complete rounds where agents contribute, then sync
%% - Event-Driven: Agents contribute when triggered by state changes
%% - Priority-Driven: Higher priority agents execute first
%% - Convergence: Stop when solution stabilizes or time expires
%% - Vector Storage: Use embeddings for semantic search on blackboard
%%
%% When To Use:
%% ✓ Complex problems requiring diverse expertise
%% ✓ Solution emerges from collaborative refinement
%% ✓ Agents can work asynchronously
%% ✓ Need multiple rounds of iteration and refinement
%% ✓ No strict ordering between agent contributions
%%
%% When NOT To Use:
%% ✗ Simple problems resolvable by single agent
%% ✗ Require real-time synchronous decisions
%% ✗ Strict ordering critical (use sequential)
%% ✗ Storage/retrieval of shared state becomes bottleneck
%%
%% Contribution Types:
%% 1. Constraints: Limitations agents must work within
%% 2. Solutions: Proposed approaches or components
%% 3. Analysis: Evaluation of current state
%% 4. Refinements: Improvements to existing proposals
%% 5. Questions: Requests for additional analysis
%% 6. Alternatives: Different approaches to consider
%%
%% State Evolution:
%% Round 1: Initial problem statement, high-level constraints
%% Round 2: Specialized contributions from each domain
%% Round 3: Refinement addressing conflicts/concerns
%% Round 4: Convergence toward final solution
%% Round 5: Final refinement and sign-off
%%
%% Knowledge Structure on Blackboard:
%% - Requirements: What needs to be solved
%% - Constraints: Boundaries of solution space
%% - Proposals: Potential solutions or components
%% - Analysis: Pro/con evaluations
%% - Conflicts: Unresolved disagreements
%% - Dependencies: What depends on what
%% - History: How we got here
%%
%% Performance Characteristics:
%% - Latency: Multiple rounds × longest agent latency
%% - Throughput: Scales with number of agents
%% - Scalability: Good (asynchronous avoids coordination bottleneck)
%% - Resilience: High (missing agent delays but doesn't block)
%% - Cost: Multiple agent invocations × number of rounds
%%
%% Convergence Criteria:
%% - Solution Stability: State unchanging for N rounds
%% - Objective Score: Solution meets minimum quality threshold
%% - Time Limit: Maximum iterations completed
%% - Consensus: All agents agree solution is ready
%% - User Satisfaction: User approves current solution
%%
%% Monitoring & Debugging:
%% - Track contribution history of each agent
%% - Visualize state evolution over rounds
%% - Identify where conflicts arise
%% - Detect if agents are converging or oscillating
%% - Analyze which agents most influence final solution
%%
%% Related Patterns:
%% - Parallel Pattern: Multiple agents, centrally aggregated
%% - Hierarchical Pattern: Top-down vs collaborative
%% - Competitive Pattern: Multiple solutions compete vs collaborate
%% - Network/Swarm: Local P2P vs shared workspace
