%% Pattern Documentation
%% ==================
%% Pattern Name: Competitive Pattern
%% Article: Article 2 - Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns
%%
%% Pattern Description:
%% The Competitive Pattern distributes the same problem to multiple agents working
%% in parallel, each approaching it differently. Their solutions compete for selection,
%% with an evaluator agent determining the winner(s) based on predefined criteria.
%% Competition drives quality and innovation through diverse approaches.
%%
%% Business Value:
%% - Innovation: Multiple approaches often reveal breakthrough solutions
%% - Quality: Competition raises the bar for all participants
%% - Objectivity: Evaluator removes politics from selection
%% - Exploration: Discover solutions that single agents might miss
%% - Risk Reduction: If one approach fails, others provide alternatives
%%
%% Key Characteristics:
%% 1. Parallel Generation: Same problem, multiple agents, different approaches
%% 2. Independent Solutions: Agents work without seeing competitors' work
%% 3. Objective Evaluation: Clear criteria for judging solutions
%% 4. Diverse Approaches: Agents use different models or prompting strategies
%% 5. Winner Selection: Top N solutions chosen, not necessarily just one
%%
%% Real-World Use Cases:
%% 1. Creative Campaign Generation
%%    - 5 copywriters generate different campaign concepts
%%    - Evaluator scores on brand alignment, creativity, conversion potential
%%    - Top 3 presented to client, client approval: 68%→91%
%%    - Result: +43% CTR, 2 weeks→2 days, -55% cost per campaign
%%
%% 2. Algorithm Optimization
%%    - Multiple agents propose different optimization approaches
%%    - Evaluate on performance, efficiency, maintainability
%%    - Select best algorithm for production
%%    - Result: Faster algorithms, lower computational cost
%%
%% 3. Strategic Planning
%%    - Different agents propose different business strategies
%%    - Evaluate on revenue potential, risk, feasibility
%%    - Select best strategy for execution
%%    - Result: Better strategic alignment, lower execution risk
%%
%% 4. Product Design Options
%%    - Multiple design agents create different product concepts
%%    - Evaluate on manufacturability, cost, user appeal
%%    - Select design to proceed with
%%    - Result: Better products faster, lower rework
%%
%% 5. Code Solution Generation
%%    - Multiple agents write different code implementations
%%    - Evaluate on performance, readability, maintainability
%%    - Select best implementation
%%    - Result: Better code, faster development
%%
%% 6. Marketing Copy Testing
%%    - Multiple agents write different ad copy variations
%%    - Evaluate on predicted CTR, conversion, relevance
%%    - Select top performers for A/B testing
%%    - Result: Higher conversion rates, better ROI
%%
%% Implementation Patterns:
%% - Diversity Inducement: Use different models, prompts, or parameters
%% - Blind Competition: Agents don't see competitors' work
%% - Scoring Rubric: Clear evaluation criteria
%% - Top-K Selection: Choose top K rather than just winner
%% - Iterative Refinement: Winner can be refined further
%%
%% When To Use:
%% ✓ High-stakes decisions where optimal solution matters
%% ✓ Creative problems without single correct answer
%% ✓ Want to explore solution space broadly
%% ✓ Can afford cost of multiple solution attempts
%% ✓ Quality more important than speed
%%
%% When NOT To Use:
%% ✗ Time-critical, real-time decisions
%% ✗ Cost-sensitive operations with tight budgets
%% ✗ Well-defined problems with known solutions
%% ✗ Simple problems not worth exploring
%%
%% Competition Parameters:
%% 1. Number of Competitors: 2-10 typically optimal
%% 2. Diversity: Different models, prompts, temperatures
%% 3. Scoring Criteria: 3-7 weighted dimensions
%% 4. Selection: Top 1 (single) or Top K (multiple)
%% 5. Refinement: Winner can be further optimized
%%
%% Evaluation Criteria Examples:
%% - Creative: Brand alignment, originality, memorability
%% - Technical: Performance, efficiency, maintainability
%% - Business: Revenue potential, risk, feasibility
%% - User: Appeal, usability, accessibility
%%
%% Performance Characteristics:
%% - Latency: Parallel execution (one winner's latency)
%% - Throughput: Limited by evaluator
%% - Scalability: Linear with number of competitors
%% - Resilience: Excellent (multiple solutions reduce risk)
%% - Cost: Higher (multiple agents for same problem)
%%
%% Related Patterns:
%% - Parallel Pattern: Multiple agents, same goal, aggregated results
%% - Supervisor Pattern: Routing between different specialists
%% - Reflection Pattern: Single agent iterates and improves
%% - Hierarchical Pattern: Multi-level competition
